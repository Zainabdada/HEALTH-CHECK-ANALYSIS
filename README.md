workplace.

Two datasets will be used to conduct this analysis such as the employees information and employees performance. The analysis and tools used in this report is the Structured Query Language and the Tableau visualization tool we seek to uncover insights that will inform actions and recommendations to promote gender equity in salary distribution.

The task involved examining whether there is a correlation between an employee's annual salary and their gender.

### Data Sources

SELECT AVG(Employee_Performance.Annual_Salary) AS avg_annual_salary, Employee_Information.gender 
FROM Employee_Performance 
JOIN Employee_Information 
ON Employee_Performance.Employee_ID = Employee_Information.Employee_ID 
GROUP BY Employee_Information.gender;
```

### Tableau Visualization 
The diagram below reflect the relationship between annual salary and gender. From our key question,  the diagram explains that the annual salary of all the employees varies differently across the three identified genders. For female employees, the annual salary is around Â£79,487 annually and although male employees and Non-Binary employees figures seem closely equal, there is still a difference incurred by male employees. , making the Non-Binary employees the highest paid.

### Recommendations

- Implement measures to mitigate gender bias in salary negotiations and performance evaluations. 

- Provide training and education on gender equity and unconscious bias for all employees, especially those involved in salary decisions.

- Regularly monitor and analyze salary data to track progress and identify any ongoing disparities.
